# Glossary

### Issuer

Issuer is an entity that is willing to take the overhead of verifying a user's ownership of an identifier.

---

### Plaintext Identifier

`plainTextIdentifier` is any string of text that a user can use to identify other user.

Phone number, Twitter handle, GitHub username anything that makes it easier to represent an evm based address.

For example:- Alice's phone number: `+12345678901`

---

### Obfuscated Identifier

Identifier that is used on-chain, to which the account address is mapped and used by dApps to lookup. It preserve the privacy of the user by not revealing the underlying plainTextIdentifier. Used for on-chain attestations, obtained by hashing the plaintext identifier, identifier prefix, and pepper using this schema: `sha3(sha3({prefix}://{plaintextIdentifier})__{pepper})`.

---

### IdentifierPrefix

Identifier Prefix is used to differentiate users having same plainTextIdentifier for different purposes and composability.

For example:- Consider Alice having same username on both Twitter and Github, `alicecodes`.

How do we differentiate between Alice verified using Twitter and Github?
This is where `prefix` comes into play, the plainTextIdentifier `alicecodes` can be represented as `twitter://alicecodes` and `github://alicecodes` this helps differentiate whether Alice was verified using Twitter or Github.

Moreover, it also helps in composability if dApps follow a standard and use prefix then the corresponding `obsfuscatedIdentifier` will be the same thus making it easier for dApps to lookup identifier verified by other issuers.

You can keep an eye on prefixes suggested by us [here](https://github.com/celo-org/social-connect/blob/main/packages/odis-identifiers/src/identifier.ts#L25).

### Pepper

`pepper` is a unique secret, obtained by taking the first 13 characters of the `sha256` hash of the `unblinded signature`.

---

### Unblinded Signature

Obtained by unblinding the signature returned by ODIS which is the combined output, comprised of signature by ODIS signers.
