# Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Issuer need to pay for gas?

For lookup there is no requirement for gas, assuming that the `obfuscatedIdentifier` to be used for lookup is available.

For registering attestations it is optional, once the `obfuscatedIdentifier` is obtained issuer can decide whether to just sign the attestation and provide it back to the user which will then **use its own funds for gas for registering itself** or the `issuer` can perform the transaction which will require the issuer to pay for gas.

### Does Issuer need to have ODIS quota?

Yes, Issuer needs to have ODIS Quota to register and lookup users.

---

### What is cost to register a user?

With 10 cUSD worth of ODIS quota you can attest 10,000 users!

---

### Can I just lookup users and not register them?

Yes, you can lookup users under other Issuers. By doing this, you are trusting that the Issuer took care about verifying that the identifier does actually belong to the user.
You might want to do this if you don't want to create a registry of your own and use an already existing registry created by other Issuers.

### What's the best way to map an address returned by lookupAttestations to the issuer?

```solidity
function lookupAttestations(bytes32 identifier, address[] calldata trustedIssuers)
    external
    view
    returns (
      uint256[] memory countsPerIssuer,
      address[] memory accounts,
      address[] memory signers,
      uint64[] memory issuedOns,
      uint64[] memory publishedOns
    )
```

`lookupAttestations` returns 4 arrays, depending on the order `trustedIssuers` was provided respectively the return values are returned.

For example:-

if trustedIssuers = [I1, I2, ...] then countsPerIssuer = [CI1, CI2, ...] where CIx = number of accounts attested under the Xth issuer

### Is there a convention for phone number format?

Yes, the SDK function `getObfuscatedIdentifier` will only accept E164 formatted phone numbers.
